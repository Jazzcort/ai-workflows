# AI workflows, driven by Goose AI, related with Jira tickets.

For Goose AI to be able to access Jira tickets you need an MCP Server.
In this workflows we are using [MCP server for Atlassian tools](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian).

## Configure

1. Copy `.env.template` in `.env` and open the newly created `.env` file.
2. Set your Gemini key in `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (take it from Google Cloud -> API & Services -> Credentials -> API Keys -> show key)
3. Set your Jira Personal Token in `JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN` (create PATs in your Jira/Confluence profile settings - usually under "Personal Access Tokens")
4. Change (if needed) the `JIRA_URL` not pointing at `https://issues.redhat.com/`

If you need to change the llm provider and model, they are stored in the goose config file: files/goose-config.yaml (`GOOSE_PROVIDER`, `GOOSE_MODEL`)

## Build

`make build`

## Run goose - interactively - with the mcp atlassian server

1. `make run-mcp-server`
2. `make run-goose`
3. Type *List all In Progress issues at https://issues.redhat.com/projects/LD* and wait for the output.
