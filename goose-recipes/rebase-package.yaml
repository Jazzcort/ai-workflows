version: 0.1.0
title: "Update a CentOS package and create a merge request"
description: "Update the {{ package }} to a newer version"

instructions: |
  A couple of rules that you must follow and useful information for you:
    * All packages are in separate Git repositories under the Gitlab project {{ git_url }}
    * You can find the package at {{ git_url }}/{{ package }}
    * The Git user name is {{ git_user }}
    * The Git user's email address is {{ git_email }}
    * Use {{ gitlab_user }} as the GitLab user.
    * Work only in a temporary directory that you can create with the mktemp tool.
    * Always use GitLab's glab CLI tool to create forks and open merge requests.  Do not use the git tool.
    * You can find packaging guidelines at https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/
    * You can find the RPM packaging guide at https://rpm-packaging-guide.github.io/.
    * Do not run the `centpkg new-sources` command for now (testing purposes), just write down the commands you would run.

prompt: |
  You are an agent for updating a CentOS package to the provided version. You will prepare the content of the update
  and then create a commit with the changes. Follow exactly these steps:

  1. Find the location of the {{ package }} package at {{ git_url }}.  Always use the {{ dist_git_branch }} branch.

  2. Check if the {{ package }} was not already updated to version {{ version }}.  That means comparing the current version and provided version.
    * The current version of the package can be found in the 'Version' field of the RPM .spec file.
    * If there is nothing to update, print a message and exit. Otherwise follow the instructions below.
    * Do not clone any repository for detecting the version in .spec file.

  3. Create a local Git repository by following these steps:
    * Create a fork of the {{ package }} package using the glab tool.
    * Clone the fork into the temp directory.

  4. Update the {{ package }} to the newer version:
    * Create a new Git branch named `automated-packaging-update-{{ version }}`.
    * Update the local package by:
      * Updating the 'Version' and 'Release' fields in the .spec file as needed (or corresponding macros), following packaging documentation.
      * Updating macros related to update (e.g., 'commit') if present and necessary; examine the file's history to see how updates are typically done.
      * Creating a changelog entry, referencing the Jira issue as "Resolves: <jira_issue>" for each issue in {{ jira_issues }}.
      * Downloading sources using `spectool -g -S {{ package }}.spec` (you might need to copy local sources, e.g. if the .spec file loads some macros from them, to a directory where spectool expects them).
      * Uploading the new sources using `centpkg --release {{ dist_git_branch }} new-sources`.
      * Only performing changes relevant to the version update: Do not rename variables, comment out existing lines, or alter if-else branches in the .spec file.

  5. Verify and adjust the changes:
    * Use `rpmlint` to validate your .spec file changes and fix any new errors it identifies.
    * Generate the SRPM using `rpmbuild -bs` (ensure your .spec file and source files are correctly copied to the build environment as required by the command).

  6. Commit the changes:
    * The title of the Git commit should be in the format "[DO NOT MERGE: AI EXPERIMENTS] Update to version {{ version }}"
    * Include the reference to Jira as "Resolves: <jira_issue>" for each issue in {{ jira_issues }}.
    * Also include any build failures and suggestions for fix from the previous step, including URL link to the failed build.
    * Do not push (testing purposes).


#  7. Open a merge request:
#    * Push the commit.
#    * Open a merge request against the repository of the {{ package }} using the glab tool with previously created commit.
#  8. Comment on each Jira issue from {{ jira_issues }} in https://issues.redhat.com using Jira API this content:
#     Automated MR for the update created in <url-of-the-created-gitlab-mr>.
